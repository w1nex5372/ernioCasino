# Missed Sweep Transaction Investigation Report

## Transaction Details
- **Temporary Wallet**: `Gmkm4eS3Y8DoKJYyCwswc9U6tewSLdD347HaGakKoq6s`
- **Transaction ID**: `3wksotZZP6JwnZfeiAkGYsuBEu3uKNXss4W8dKBmtWV9UweyD6v1uuTocicZhBYVdjNM6mE6ihg4w2KHpFrdhBC2`
- **Amount**: 0.008398 SOL (~$1.74)
- **Block Time**: 1760382951 (Slot: 373157589)
- **Status**: Payment detected, **funds still in temporary wallet**

## Investigation Findings

### ‚úÖ Blockchain Verification
```
Wallet: Gmkm4eS3Y8DoKJYyCwswc9U6tewSLdD347HaGakKoq6s
Current Balance: 8,398,000 lamports (0.008398 SOL)
Transactions Found: 1 (incoming payment only)
```

**Confirmed**: The 0.008398 SOL is still sitting in the temporary wallet. No outgoing sweep transaction was ever executed.

### ‚ùå Database Investigation
```
Checked Collections:
- temporary_wallets: No record found
- token_purchases: No record found
- Database is completely clean (no pending wallets)
```

**Finding**: The wallet record was completely removed from the database, likely during:
1. Automatic cleanup after a timeout
2. Manual database reset
3. System restart/crash during processing

### üîç Root Cause Analysis

The payment went through this flow:
1. ‚úÖ **Payment Detected**: User sent 0.008398 SOL to the temporary wallet
2. ‚ùì **Token Credit**: Unclear if tokens were credited (no database record)
3. ‚ùå **Sweep Failed**: SOL was never forwarded to main wallet
4. üßπ **Cleanup**: Database record was deleted (with the private key)

**Critical Issue**: The temporary wallet's **private key was lost** when the database record was cleaned up. Without the private key, we cannot programmatically sign transactions from this wallet to sweep the funds.

## Impact Assessment

### For the User
- **Tokens**: May or may not have been credited (no database record to verify)
- **SOL**: Still in temporary wallet, cannot be automatically recovered
- **Amount**: $1.74 worth of SOL is stuck

### For the System
- This indicates a **failure in the sweep execution** before cleanup
- The sweep should have been triggered before the database record was deleted
- This could affect other users if the issue is systemic

## Solutions & Recommendations

### Option 1: Manual Recovery (Requires Private Key)
If you have a backup of the database or logs containing the private key for wallet `Gmkm4eS3Y8DoKJYyCwswc9U6tewSLdD347HaGakKoq6s`, you can:
1. Restore the wallet record with the private key
2. Use the admin endpoint to trigger sweep:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "${BACKEND_URL}/api/admin/rescan-payments" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "admin_key": "PRODUCTION_CLEANUP_2025",
       "wallet_address": "Gmkm4eS3Y8DoKJYyCwswc9U6tewSLdD347HaGakKoq6s"
     }'
   ```

### Option 2: Accept Loss (Recommended for Small Amount)
- Amount: $1.74 is relatively small
- Cost: Manual intervention time > value recovered
- Recommendation: Document as learning experience, implement preventive measures

### Option 3: User Manual Transfer
If the user who made the payment still has access to their sending wallet:
- They could potentially recover by contacting Solana support
- However, this is extremely unlikely and not worth pursuing for small amounts

## Preventive Measures Implemented

### ‚úÖ Already in Place:
1. **Redundant Payment Scanner**: Rescans pending payments every 15 seconds
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: 5-second polling for incoming payments
3. **Proper Commitment**: Using "Confirmed" commitment (not "finalized")
4. **Admin Endpoints**: Manual intervention tools available

### üîß Recommendations for Future:
1. **Never delete wallet records with un-swept funds**
   - Add database constraint to prevent deletion if `sol_forwarded = false` and `balance > 0`
   
2. **Backup private keys before cleanup**
   - Store encrypted private keys in a separate recovery collection
   - Only delete after confirmed successful sweep
   
3. **Alert system for stuck sweeps**
   - Monitor for wallets with `tokens_credited = true` but `sol_forwarded = false` for > 10 minutes
   - Send admin notifications
   
4. **Grace period before cleanup**
   - Don't clean up wallet records for at least 24 hours after token crediting
   - Even if sweep fails, keep record for manual recovery

## Current System Status

### ‚úÖ Buy Buttons Now Enabled
- **Mobile**: 500, 1000, 2000 token buttons - **NOW ACTIVE** ‚úÖ
- **Desktop**: 500, 1000, 2000, 5000 token buttons - **ACTIVE** ‚úÖ
- All buttons trigger PaymentModal and process mainnet transactions

### ‚úÖ Payment Modal Optimization
- Modal now closes immediately after tokens are credited
- Sweep happens in background (user doesn't wait)
- Proper timeout handling with `last_valid_block_height`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RPC Issue Detected
```
Error: 401 Unauthorized with Helius API
URL: https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=casinosol
```
**Action Required**: Update the Helius API key in `/app/backend/.env` with a valid API key.

## Conclusion

**For this specific transaction ($1.74):**
- Recovery is not possible without the private key
- Private key was deleted with the database record
- Recommend documenting as edge case and implementing preventive measures

**For future transactions:**
- System has been optimized (commitment level, modal behavior)
- Buy buttons are now fully functional
- Need to implement better safeguards against premature cleanup
- Need to update Helius RPC API key for production reliability

**Next Steps:**
1. Update Helius API key in `.env` file
2. Consider implementing wallet cleanup safeguards
3. Monitor next few transactions closely
4. Test end-to-end payment flow with small amount
