# Work for Casino System v8.0 - Complete Documentation

## Overview
The "Work for Casino" system allows users to become casino workers by purchasing access, uploading hidden gifts with photos and coordinates, and having those gifts automatically distributed to game winners based on city matching.

## System Architecture

### 1. City-Based System
Users select a city (London or Paris) after Telegram authentication. This city determines:
- Which game rooms they play in
- Which gifts they can receive as winners
- Where their uploaded gifts will be assigned

### 2. Work Access Purchase
**Cost:** 1000 tokens (symbolic, represents ~10 EUR)
- No actual tokens are deducted from user balance
- Payment is processed via Solana (dynamic EUR/SOL conversion)
- After successful payment, user receives work access

**Payment Flow:**
1. User clicks "Work for Casino" button
2. System calculates SOL equivalent (e.g., 10 EUR = 0.1 SOL if 1 SOL = 100 EUR)
3. Solana payment modal opens with generated wallet address
4. User sends SOL payment
5. System confirms transaction
6. Telegram bot sends confirmation: "Welcome to the Casino Team! Click to start working"

### 3. Gift Upload System

**Requirements:**
- User must have purchased work access
- User must have selected a city

**Upload Fields:**
- **Photo:** Base64 encoded image of the hidden gift
- **Coordinates:** Latitude and longitude of gift location
- **City:** London or Paris (determines which players can receive this gift)

**Database Schema:**
```json
{
  "gift_id": "uuid",
  "creator_user_id": "USER123",
  "creator_telegram_id": 123456789,
  "creator_username": "worker_username",
  "city": "Paris",
  "photo_base64": "data:image/jpeg;base64,...",
  "coordinates": {
    "lat": 48.8566,
    "lng": 2.3522
  },
  "status": "available",
  "assigned_to": null,
  "assigned_to_user_id": null,
  "winner_name": null,
  "winner_city": null,
  "assigned_at": null,
  "delivered": false,
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### 4. Automatic Gift Assignment

**Trigger:** When a game finishes and a winner is determined

**Assignment Logic:**
1. Get winner's city from user profile
2. Query database for one available gift in that city:
   ```python
   gift = db.gifts.find_one_and_update(
       {"city": winner_city, "status": "available"},
       {"$set": {
           "status": "assigned",
           "assigned_to": winner_telegram_id,
           "assigned_to_user_id": winner_user_id,
           "winner_name": winner_username,
           "winner_city": winner_city,
           "assigned_at": datetime.now(timezone.utc),
           "delivered": True
       }},
       return_document=True
   )
   ```
3. If gift found ‚Üí Send Telegram message with gift details
4. If no gift found ‚Üí Send Telegram message: "No gifts available in your city"

**Telegram Notifications:**

**With Gift:**
```
üéâ Congratulations {username}!
üéÅ You have a special gift waiting!

üìç Location: Paris
üìä Coordinates: 48.8566, 2.3522

Check the app for the gift photo and details!

**Without Gift:**
```
üéâ Congratulations {username}!

You won the battle!

‚ö†Ô∏è No gifts available in your city right now.
New gifts will be added by casino workers soon!
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] City selection appears after Telegram auth
- [ ] City persists across sessions
- [ ] "Work for Casino" button visible
- [ ] Work access purchase via Solana works
- [ ] Telegram confirmation sent after purchase
- [ ] Gift upload form accepts photo + coordinates
- [ ] Gifts tagged with correct city
- [ ] Game winner receives gift from their city
- [ ] Telegram notification sent to winner
- [ ] Admin can view assigned gifts
- [ ] Admin can view statistics
- [ ] No gifts message when city has no available gifts
- [ ] Game flow still works correctly (GET READY ‚Üí Winner ‚Üí Redirect)

## Security Considerations

1. **Admin Authentication:** All admin endpoints verify `telegram_username == "cia_nera"`
2. **Work Access Verification:** Gift upload requires `work_access_purchased == true`
3. **City Validation:** Only "London" and "Paris" are accepted
4. **Photo Size:** Recommend limiting base64 photo size to prevent database bloat
5. **Coordinate Validation:** Ensure lat/lng are valid numbers within reasonable ranges

## Future Enhancements

1. **Gift Photos in Telegram:** Send gift photo directly in Telegram message
2. **Gift Categories:** Different gift types (bronze, silver, gold)
3. **Worker Leaderboard:** Track most active gift uploaders
4. **Gift Expiry:** Auto-remove old, unassigned gifts
5. **Multiple Cities:** Add more cities beyond London and Paris
6. **Gift Preview:** Allow workers to preview their uploaded gifts
7. **Winner Gift Gallery:** UI to view received gifts
