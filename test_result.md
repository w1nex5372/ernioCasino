# Testing Protocol and Results

## Original User Problem Statement

Users reported three critical issues:
1. Winner screen not shown for all players
2. "Waiting for 3 players" appears again after GET READY
3. Players not redirected to home automatically after game

Additionally, implementing new "Work for Casino" system with:
- City-based room selection
- Worker access via Solana payment (1000 tokens symbolic)
- Gift upload system (photo + coordinates + city)
- Automatic gift assignment to winners based on city
- Admin dashboard for @cia_nera

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing
- Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` for all backend API and Socket.IO event testing
- Test authentication, payment flows, gift upload, and admin endpoints
- Verify Socket.IO event synchronization and room management

### Frontend Testing  
- After backend testing, confirm with user whether to use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` or manual testing
- Test UI flows: city selection, Work for Casino, gift upload, game synchronization
- Verify winner screen and redirect behavior across multiple clients

### Test Communication
- Always update this file before invoking testing agents
- Document all test results and issues found
- Never fix issues already resolved by testing agents

## Incorporate User Feedback
- If user reports issues, investigate and fix before re-testing
- Always verify fixes with appropriate testing approach

## Phase 9: Fix Join-Room 500 Error (In Progress)

**Date**: 2025-01-27

**Issue Reported**: 
Users experiencing 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to join a room. Root cause identified: `join-room` endpoint tried to access `ROOM_SETTINGS[request.room_type]['gift_type']` but the key was missing from ROOM_SETTINGS dictionary.

**Fix Applied**:
1. ✅ Added `gift_type` key to all room types in ROOM_SETTINGS:
   - BRONZE: "1gift"
   - SILVER: "2gifts"  
   - GOLD: "5gifts"
   - PLATINUM: "10gifts"
   - DIAMOND: "20gifts"
   - ELITE: "50gifts"
2. ✅ Backend service restarted to apply changes

**Testing Plan**:
- Test join-room endpoint with various room types
- Verify gift availability checks work correctly  
- Ensure no 500 errors occur
- Test with and without available gifts in user's city

**Test Scenarios to Cover**:
1. Join room with available gifts in user's city
2. Join room without available gifts (should get proper error message)
3. Join different room types (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Elite)
4. Verify gift_type validation works for all room types
