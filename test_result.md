# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Room status progression working perfectly: 0/3 → 1/3 → 2/3 → 3/3 → GAME STARTS immediately. Game completed successfully with winner 'Tarofkinas' selected and displayed correctly.

Verified room status progression 0/3 → 1/3 → 2/3 → 3/3 with game starting only when 3rd player joins. All rooms show max_players=3. ✅ BUG 2 FIXED - Real Telegram Names: Players show real names like 'cia nera', 'Tarofkinas', 'Teror' instead of generic 'Participant2/3'. Fixed backend issue where username field was incorrectly mapped - changed from user_doc.get('username') to user_doc.get('telegram_username') in RoomPlayer creation. ✅ BUG 3 FIXED - Unlimited Tokens: Verified specific users @cia_nera (telegram_id: 1793011013), @Teror (telegram_id: 7983427898), @Tarofkinas (telegram_id: 6168593741) all have 999M+ tokens as requested. System automatically creates users with unlimited tokens if they don't exist. ✅ BUG 4 FIXED - Winner Display: Winners are properly shown to all players with real names in game history. Verified winner 'Tarofkinas' displayed correctly with real name instead of generic participant name. ✅ COMPLETE 3-PLAYER SCENARIO TESTED: End-to-end testing with all 3 specific users joining Bronze room, game starting only when 3rd player joins, winner selection working correctly, and all players seeing winner with real name. All API endpoints (GET /api/rooms, GET /api/room-participants/{room_type}, POST /api/join-room) working correctly for 3-player system.
