# Testing Protocol and Results

## Original User Problem Statement

Users reported three critical issues:
1. Winner screen not shown for all players
2. "Waiting for 3 players" appears again after GET READY
3. Players not redirected to home automatically after game

Additionally, implementing new "Work for Casino" system with:
- City-based room selection
- Worker access via Solana payment (1000 tokens symbolic)
- Gift upload system (photo + coordinates + city)
- Automatic gift assignment to winners based on city
- Admin dashboard for @cia_nera

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing
- Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` for all backend API and Socket.IO event testing
- Test authentication, payment flows, gift upload, and admin endpoints
- Verify Socket.IO event synchronization and room management

### Frontend Testing  
- After backend testing, confirm with user whether to use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` or manual testing
- Test UI flows: city selection, Work for Casino, gift upload, game synchronization
- Verify winner screen and redirect behavior across multiple clients

### Test Communication
- Always update this file before invoking testing agents
- Document all test results and issues found
- Never fix issues already resolved by testing agents

## Incorporate User Feedback
- If user reports issues, investigate and fix before re-testing
- Always verify fixes with appropriate testing approach
