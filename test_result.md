# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Optimize Solana transaction commitment from 'finalized' to 'confirmed' to reduce payment sweep confirmation delay from 3-5 minutes to ~10-30 seconds. Fix payment modal to close immediately after tokens are credited without waiting for sweep completion."

This ensures sweep confirmation properly times out after blockhash expiry (~60-90s) instead of waiting indefinitely. Expected impact: Faster sweep confirmation, proper timeout handling."

Previous logic had 3 states: 1) payment_detected && !tokens_credited (processing) 2) tokens_credited && !sol_forwarded (crediting - STUCK STATE) 3) tokens_credited (complete - never reached due to #2). New simplified logic has 2 states: 1) payment_detected && !tokens_credited (processing) 2) tokens_credited (complete - closes modal). Modal now closes immediately after tokens are credited, regardless of sweep status. Sweep happens in background transparently to user."

      message: "CRITICAL OPTIMIZATION COMPLETED: Fixed 3-5 minute payment modal delay issue. Root cause analysis revealed system was already using 'Confirmed' commitment (not 'finalized' as suspected). Real issues were: 1) Backend confirm_transaction not using last_valid_block_height for proper timeout 2) Frontend modal had faulty else-if logic preventing closure. Both issues now fixed. TESTING NOTE: There's a separate RPC authentication error (401 with Helius API key 'casinosol') that needs user attention - not related to these changes but may affect live testing. Please test: 1) Payment modal closes within 2 seconds after tokens credited 2) Sweep confirmation behaves properly with timeout 3) No hanging payment states."

      message: "CRITICAL 3-PLAYER LOBBY → WINNER FLOW TESTING COMPLETE: Comprehensive testing of the exact critical issue reported by user performed successfully. ✅ CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED: The reported bug 'After 3rd player joins, lobby shows Waiting for 3 more players...' is NOT occurring in backend testing. ✅ COMPLETE 3-PLAYER FLOW VERIFIED: All 3 special users (cia_nera, Tarofkinas, Teror) created successfully with unlimited tokens as requested. Room status progression working perfectly: 0/3 → 1/3 → 2/3 → 3/3 → GAME STARTS. Game completed successfully with winner 'Tarofkinas' selected and displayed correctly. Room reset to empty state after game completion. ✅ BACKEND FUNCTIONALITY CONFIRMED: All API endpoints responding correctly (/api/rooms, /api/join-room, /api/game-history, /api/user/{id}/prizes). Game start logic triggers correctly when exactly 3 players join. Winner selection and prize distribution working. Telegram notifications attempted successfully. ✅ TESTING RESULTS: 39/48 backend tests passed (81% success rate). Critical 3-player flow test PASSED. Minor issues found: Solana address derivation errors (500 status), some user lookup failures in subsequent tests, daily tokens invalid user returns 500 instead of 404. ✅ CONCLUSION: The critical user-reported issue appears to be resolved at the backend level. The 3-player game flow is working correctly from lobby to winner screen. The issue may be frontend-related or user-specific rather than a backend bug."
