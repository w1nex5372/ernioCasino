# Testing Protocol and Results

## Original User Problem Statement

Users reported three critical issues:
1. Winner screen not shown for all players
2. "Waiting for 3 players" appears again after GET READY
3. Players not redirected to home automatically after game

Additionally, implementing new "Work for Casino" system with:
- City-based room selection
- Worker access via Solana payment (1000 tokens symbolic)
- Gift upload system (photo + coordinates + city)
- Automatic gift assignment to winners based on city
- Admin dashboard for @cia_nera

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing
- Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` for all backend API and Socket.IO event testing
- Test authentication, payment flows, gift upload, and admin endpoints
- Verify Socket.IO event synchronization and room management

### Frontend Testing  
- After backend testing, confirm with user whether to use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` or manual testing
- Test UI flows: city selection, Work for Casino, gift upload, game synchronization
- Verify winner screen and redirect behavior across multiple clients

### Test Communication
- Always update this file before invoking testing agents
- Document all test results and issues found
- Never fix issues already resolved by testing agents

## Incorporate User Feedback
- If user reports issues, investigate and fix before re-testing
- Always verify fixes with appropriate testing approach

## Concurrent Game Flow Testing Results

### Test Scenario: Multiple Sets of 3 Players Joining Bronze Room Simultaneously

**Test Date**: 2025-10-17  
**Test Status**: ✅ **PASSED**

#### Test Execution Summary
- **Created**: 9 test users (User1-User9) with sufficient tokens (1000 each)
- **Game 1**: User1, User2, User3 → ✅ Completed → Winner: User1
- **Game 2**: User4, User5, User6 → ✅ Completed → Winner: User4  
- **Game 3**: User7, User8, User9 → ✅ Completed → Winner: User9

#### Success Criteria Verification ✅
1. **Room Creation**: ✅ New bronze rooms created correctly when previous fills
2. **Room Isolation**: ✅ Each set of 3 players in their own room/game
3. **Socket.IO Events**: ✅ Events sent to correct rooms (room_ready, game_finished, redirect_home)
4. **Winner Selection**: ✅ Each game selected winner independently
5. **Room Cleanup**: ✅ After each game, room deleted and new empty one created
6. **History**: ✅ Game history shows all 3 completed games with correct details
7. **No Crashes**: ✅ Backend handled concurrent games without errors
8. **Room States**: ✅ Active rooms properly managed before/during/after games

#### API Endpoints Tested ✅

#### Technical Details
- **Total Test Duration**: ~45 seconds
- **Game Completion Time**: ~8 seconds per game (3s ready + 3s game + 2s cleanup)
- **Room Transitions**: waiting → ready → playing → finished → new waiting room
- **Prize Pool**: 900 tokens per game (3 players × 300 tokens each)
- **Round Numbers**: Games completed in rounds 11, 12, and 13

#### Key Findings
