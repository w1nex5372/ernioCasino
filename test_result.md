# Testing Protocol and Results

## Original User Problem Statement

Users reported three critical issues:
1. Winner screen not shown for all players
2. "Waiting for 3 players" appears again after GET READY
3. Players not redirected to home automatically after game

Additionally, implementing new "Work for Casino" system with:
- City-based room selection
- Worker access via Solana payment (1000 tokens symbolic)
- Gift upload system (photo + coordinates + city)
- Automatic gift assignment to winners based on city
- Admin dashboard for @cia_nera

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing
- Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` for all backend API and Socket.IO event testing
- Test authentication, payment flows, gift upload, and admin endpoints
- Verify Socket.IO event synchronization and room management

### Frontend Testing  
- After backend testing, confirm with user whether to use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` or manual testing
- Test UI flows: city selection, Work for Casino, gift upload, game synchronization
- Verify winner screen and redirect behavior across multiple clients

### Test Communication
- Always update this file before invoking testing agents
- Document all test results and issues found
- Never fix issues already resolved by testing agents

## Incorporate User Feedback
- If user reports issues, investigate and fix before re-testing
- Always verify fixes with appropriate testing approach

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Game Flow Synchronization (Completed)
- Status: ✅ Backend logic implemented & Frontend enhanced
- Goal: Fix winner screen sync and auto-redirect
- Backend game flow: room_ready (T+0) → game_starting (T+3) → game_finished (T+6) → redirect_home (T+9)
- Frontend: Improved socket reconnection logic with 10 attempts, 2-20 second delays
- Fixed: Lobby no longer reappears after GET READY screen
- Testing: Pending

### Phase 2: City-Based System (Completed)
- Status: ✅ Implemented
- Goal: Add city selection and filtering
- Features: City selector modal, city display in mobile/desktop header, city stored in user profile

### Phase 3: Work for Casino System (Completed)
- Status: ✅ Implemented & Mobile UI Fixed
- Goal: Implement payment, gift upload, auto-assignment
- Features: Work for Casino button (visible on mobile & desktop), payment modal integration, gift upload form, automatic gift assignment to winners
- Mobile: Added header buttons for "Work Casino" and "Buy Tokens"
- Backend endpoints: set-city, work/purchase-access, gifts/upload, check-access
- Gift assignment: Triggered automatically when game finishes, matches winner's city

### Phase 4: Admin Dashboard (Completed)
- Status: ✅ Implemented
- Goal: Build tracking interface for @cia_nera
- Features: Admin endpoints for viewing assigned gifts and statistics
- Endpoints: /admin/gifts/assigned, /admin/gifts/stats
- Access: Restricted to telegram_username == "cia_nera"

### Phase 5: Socket Reconnection & Server Wake-up (Completed)
- Status: ✅ Enhanced
- Goal: Fix socket reconnection when servers sleep
- Features:
  - Increased reconnection attempts from 5 to 10
  - Extended timeout from 10s to 20s (for slow server wakeup)
  - Reconnection delay: 2-10 seconds between attempts
  - Auto-reconnect on server disconnect
  - User re-registration after reconnection
  - Toast notifications for connection status
  - Automatic room reload after successful reconnection

## Concurrent Game Flow Testing Results

### Test Scenario: Multiple Sets of 3 Players Joining Bronze Room Simultaneously

**Test Date**: 2025-10-17  
**Test Status**: ✅ **PASSED**

#### Test Execution Summary
- **Created**: 9 test users (User1-User9) with sufficient tokens (1000 each)
- **Game 1**: User1, User2, User3 → ✅ Completed → Winner: User1
- **Game 2**: User4, User5, User6 → ✅ Completed → Winner: User4  
- **Game 3**: User7, User8, User9 → ✅ Completed → Winner: User9

#### Success Criteria Verification ✅
1. **Room Creation**: ✅ New bronze rooms created correctly when previous fills
2. **Room Isolation**: ✅ Each set of 3 players in their own room/game
3. **Socket.IO Events**: ✅ Events sent to correct rooms (room_ready, game_finished, redirect_home)
4. **Winner Selection**: ✅ Each game selected winner independently
5. **Room Cleanup**: ✅ After each game, room deleted and new empty one created
6. **History**: ✅ Game history shows all 3 completed games with correct details
7. **No Crashes**: ✅ Backend handled concurrent games without errors
8. **Room States**: ✅ Active rooms properly managed before/during/after games

#### API Endpoints Tested ✅
- `POST /api/join-room` (9 successful calls with different users)
- `GET /api/rooms` (verified room states throughout test)
- `GET /api/game-history` (verified all 3 games recorded correctly)

#### Technical Details
- **Total Test Duration**: ~45 seconds
- **Game Completion Time**: ~8 seconds per game (3s ready + 3s game + 2s cleanup)
- **Room Transitions**: waiting → ready → playing → finished → new waiting room
- **Prize Pool**: 900 tokens per game (3 players × 300 tokens each)
- **Round Numbers**: Games completed in rounds 11, 12, and 13

#### Key Findings
- ✅ Backend successfully handles concurrent 3-player games
- ✅ Room isolation working correctly - no cross-game interference
- ✅ Socket.IO event broadcasting working properly
- ✅ Winner selection algorithm functioning independently per game
- ✅ Room cleanup and recreation working as expected
- ✅ No race conditions or crashes detected
- ✅ Game history accurately records all concurrent games

**Conclusion**: The concurrent game flow scenario works perfectly. The backend can handle multiple sets of 3 players joining bronze rooms simultaneously, with proper room isolation, winner selection, and cleanup.
