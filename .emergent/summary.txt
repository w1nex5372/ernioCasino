The AI engineer's work involved an iterative and complex journey, primarily focused on solidifying the Solana payment system, rectifying critical frontend and backend issues, and stabilizing game flow. Initial efforts tackled transaction commitment, payment recovery, and database inconsistencies, leading to significant refactoring in  and . Subsequent tasks focused on frontend UI/UX, including fixing win/loss badges, removing version labels, refining winner screens, and implementing a history refresh. Persistent Telegram WebApp caching issues necessitated aggressive cache-busting and service worker modifications, ultimately revealing a crucial domain mismatch. The latest phase addressed recurring game flow inconsistencies, such as repeating winner modals and player synchronization problems. The immediate focus is on correcting a fundamental backend Socket.IO architectural flaw where events are broadcast globally instead of to specific game rooms, highlighting a systematic problem-solving approach moving from symptoms to root causes.

The application is a Solana-based PWA casino mini-app supporting real-time betting in Bronze, Silver, and Gold rooms for 2-3 players. Winners receive prize links via private Telegram messages. In-game tokens (1 EUR = 100 tokens) are purchased using Solana. The UI must be professional, responsive, and mobile-optimized, with Telegram Web App handling authentication.

The previous work established core game mechanics, room management, daily free tokens, and continuous game cycles. Recent development focused on:
1.  **Solana Token Purchase:** Dynamic wallet generation, real-time blockchain monitoring for SOL, automatic token crediting, forwarding SOL to a main project wallet, and fetching dynamic SOL/EUR prices.
2.  **Frontend Functionality:** Fixing player loading, login, bonus, and token visibility; adding a Solana wallet connection panel and a detailed Payment Invoice screen with countdown and auto-confirmation. Ensuring UI responsiveness, user persistence, smooth transitions, error handling, multiplayer synchronization, and refined Winner Announcement/History tabs.
3.  **Core Bug Fixes:** Correcting winner display, immediate daily bonus timer updates, unrestricted EUR input (min 0.1 EUR, decimals), and Mainnet configuration with Helius RPC to resolve rate limits.
4.  **Deployment/Caching:** Resolving Telegram WebApp caching with aggressive cache busting and versioning.
5.  **Payment System Reliability:** Re-enabling payment UI, fixing payment crediting, implementing redundant payment scanning, optimizing sweep execution and timing, ensuring payment modal auto-closes, cleaning UI, making SOL amount copyable, and fixing EUR input decimal handling. Enhanced with RPC fallbacks, auto-recovery, and alert systems.
6.  **Authentication & Data Consistency**: Resolving authentication mix-ups for specific users caused by database mismatches and null user IDs.
7.  **Performance & Load Optimization**: Adding MongoDB indexing and connection pooling, implementing RPC fallback logic.
8.  **UI/UX Refinements**: Fixed Lost badge for winners, removed version label, simplified winner announcement screen (no token display), added history refresh button, implemented ROOM IS FULL animation, fixed Claim 10 button visuals and cooldown.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was tackling persistent issues related to game room synchronization and the winner announcement modal. Despite numerous fixes, users were still reporting that room states (e.g., player lists, Waiting for players messages) were not updating in real-time for all participants, and the winner modal was sometimes repeating or appearing at incorrect times.

The latest investigation focused on the backend's Socket.IO implementation in . The root cause identified is that the backend is using  which broadcasts messages to *all* connected clients globally, rather than targeting clients within specific game rooms. This means  and  events are not correctly isolated to room participants, leading to the observed synchronization failures and inconsistent UI states across players. The frontend was previously corrected to stop local mutations of the  state, now relying on backend updates, but this backend broadcasting issue is preventing proper data flow.

The AI engineer has identified this fundamental architectural flaw in the backend's Socket.IO event handling and is currently planning a comprehensive fix to introduce proper room-based broadcasting.
