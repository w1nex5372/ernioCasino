The AI engineer's work involved an iterative and complex journey, primarily focused on solidifying the Solana payment system and rectifying critical frontend and backend issues. Initially, the task involved optimizing Solana transaction commitment, which unexpectedly revealed deeper problems with transaction confirmation timeouts and frontend modal logic. Subsequent efforts meticulously tracked and recovered unswept SOL payments, involving exhaustive database searches for lost private keys and the implementation of crucial grace period safeguards. A major turning point was the discovery and correction of fundamental database inconsistencies leading to authentication mix-ups, alongside extensive debugging and refactoring of  to fix indentation and retry logic. The process highlighted the fragility of distributed systems and the necessity of robust error handling, database consistency, and precise frontend state management. The engineer systematically moved from addressing symptoms to uncovering and resolving root causes, demonstrating a comprehensive problem-solving approach.

The application is a Solana-based PWA casino mini-app supporting real-time betting in Bronze, Silver, and Gold rooms for 2-3 players. Winners receive prize links via private Telegram messages. In-game tokens (1 EUR = 100 tokens) are purchased using Solana. The UI must be professional, responsive, and mobile-optimized, with Telegram Web App handling authentication.

The previous work established core game mechanics, room management, daily free tokens, and continuous game cycles. Recent development focused on:
1.  **Solana Token Purchase:** Implementing dynamic wallet generation, real-time blockchain monitoring for SOL, automatic token crediting, forwarding SOL to a main project wallet, and fetching dynamic SOL/EUR prices.
2.  **Frontend Functionality:** Fixing player loading, login, bonus, and token visibility; adding a Solana wallet connection panel and a detailed Payment Invoice screen with countdown and auto-confirmation. Ensuring UI responsiveness, user persistence, smooth transitions, error handling, multiplayer synchronization, and refined Winner Announcement/History tabs.
3.  **Core Bug Fixes:** Correcting winner display, immediate daily bonus timer updates, unrestricted EUR input (min 0.1 EUR, decimals), and Mainnet configuration with Helius RPC to resolve rate limits.
4.  **Deployment/Caching:** Resolving Telegram WebApp caching with aggressive cache busting and versioning.
5.  **Payment System Reliability:** Re-enabling payment UI, fixing payment crediting, implementing redundant payment scanning, optimizing sweep execution and timing, ensuring payment modal auto-closes, cleaning UI, making SOL amount copyable, and fixing EUR input decimal handling.
6.  **Authentication & Data Consistency**: Resolving authentication mix-ups for specific users caused by database mismatches and null user IDs, ensuring each user loads correct data.
7.  **Performance & Load Optimization**: Adding MongoDB indexing and connection pooling, implementing RPC fallback logic, and a planned background task handling.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical authentication mix-up affecting specific users (Terror and Tarofkinas). The root cause was identified as  in the  for these users and a mismatch where the backend was querying  instead of .

The fixes implemented include:
1.  **Backend Database Configuration:** The  in  was explicitly set to , and logging was added to  to confirm correct database usage.
2.  **Data Correction:** A script was run to iterate through all users in  and assign unique UUIDs to those with .
3.  **Frontend Caching Handling:** Logic was added to  to force re-authentication if  is null when loaded from , prompting users to clear their cache/re-login.
4.  **Code Stability:** During the authentication fix, several complex indentation errors and duplicate retry loops in  (which were likely introduced during previous manual edits) were identified and meticulously corrected to restore backend functionality.

The authentication mix-up is now confirmed fixed, with both affected users loading their correct data. However, a new issue has emerged: when a player wins a game, the game history card incorrectly displays a Lost badge in the top corner, even though the winner field correctly shows the actual winner. The AI engineer is currently investigating this win/loss display logic in the frontend component responsible for rendering the badge.
