The AI engineer's work primarily focused on stabilizing a Solana-based PWA casino mini-app, addressing critical real-time synchronization, UI consistency, and deployment caching issues. Initially, fixes targeted global Socket.IO event broadcasting, which led to incorrect game state across clients. Subsequent efforts involved implementing proper room-based Socket.IO communication, fixing service worker registration for aggressive caching, and resolving race conditions causing GET READY animations to disappear or winner screens to be inconsistent. A major challenge was ensuring cross-device synchronization, especially between Telegram WebApp (mobile) and desktop. The Free 100 Players Bonus visibility was a recurring bug. The work followed an iterative debugging cycle, adding extensive logging and state management to pinpoint and resolve issues. The latest work involved a comprehensive codebase cleanup to remove unused files and dependencies.

The application is a Solana-based PWA casino mini-app enabling real-time betting in Bronze, Silver, and Gold rooms for 2-3 players. Winners receive prize links via private Telegram messages. In-game tokens (1 EUR = 100 tokens) are purchased using Solana. The UI must be professional, responsive, and mobile-optimized, with Telegram Web App handling authentication.

The previous work established core game mechanics, room management, daily free tokens, and continuous game cycles. Recent development focused on:
1.  **Solana Token Purchase:** Dynamic wallet generation, real-time blockchain monitoring for SOL, automatic token crediting, forwarding SOL to a main project wallet, and fetching dynamic SOL/EUR prices.
2.  **Frontend Functionality:** Fixing player loading, login, bonus, and token visibility; adding a Solana wallet connection panel and a detailed Payment Invoice screen with countdown and auto-confirmation. Ensuring UI responsiveness, user persistence, smooth transitions, error handling, multiplayer synchronization, and refined Winner Announcement/History tabs.
3.  **Core Bug Fixes:** Correcting winner display, immediate daily bonus timer updates, unrestricted EUR input (min 0.1 EUR, decimals), and Mainnet configuration with Helius RPC to resolve rate limits.
4.  **Deployment/Caching:** Resolving Telegram WebApp caching with aggressive cache busting and versioning.
5.  **Payment System Reliability:** Re-enabling payment UI, fixing payment crediting, implementing redundant payment scanning, optimizing sweep execution and timing, ensuring payment modal auto-closes, cleaning UI, making SOL amount copyable, and fixing EUR input decimal handling. Enhanced with RPC fallbacks, auto-recovery, and alert systems.
6.  **Authentication & Data Consistency**: Resolving authentication mix-ups for specific users caused by database mismatches and null user IDs.
7.  **Performance & Load Optimization**: Adding MongoDB indexing and connection pooling, implementing RPC fallback logic.
8.  **UI/UX Refinements**: Fixed Lost badge for winners, removed version label, simplified winner announcement screen (no token display), added history refresh button, implemented ROOM IS FULL animation, fixed Claim 10 button visuals and cooldown.
9.  **Real-time Synchronization & Event Sequencing**: Implement room-specific Socket.IO broadcasting, enforce strict event order (player_joined → room_full → room_ready → game_started → game_finished → redirect_home), ensure GET READY! animation and winner modal appear consistently for all players, and keep the Free 100 Players Bonus visible.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing three critical, user-reported issues:
1.  **Redirect to Home Screen Failure**: After the GET READY sequence and game completion, players were reportedly not being redirected to the Home screen and remained stuck on the Waiting for 3 more players lobby screen, despite the backend emitting  events.
2.  **Free 100 Players Bonus Missing**: The bonus section was completely missing for all users across devices after the latest build.
3.  **Claim 10 Button Bug**: The Claim 10 daily bonus button was reported as not working properly.

The AI engineer's most recent actions involved a comprehensive **codebase cleanup**. This was initiated after the previous fixes failed to resolve the core issues, suggesting that the codebase might be cluttered with unused files or dependencies that could contribute to unexpected behavior or make debugging harder.

The cleanup objective was to remove all unnecessary files, redundant folders, and unused dependencies to improve performance and reduce clutter. This included:
-   **Dependency Audit**: Identifying and removing unused NPM packages like , , , , and .
-   **Source Folder Audit**: Deleting old/unused UI components (keeping only , , , , , , ), and archiving 35 markdown files into a single .
-   **Backend Cleanup**: Removing .
-   **Build Verification**: Ensuring the app builds successfully with a smaller, cleaner production bundle.

The AI engineer has completed this cleanup and created a  and . The next immediate step is to restart services to verify the app builds and runs without missing module errors after the cleanup.
