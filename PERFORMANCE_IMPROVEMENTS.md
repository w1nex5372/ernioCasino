# ⚡ Payment Detection & Sweep Performance Improvements

## 🎯 Changes Implemented

### 1. Detection Speed Improvements

#### Real-Time Monitoring
- **OLD**: Checked every 10 seconds
- **NEW**: Checks every **5 seconds** ⚡ (2x faster)
- **Duration**: Monitors for 30 minutes (360 checks)

#### Redundant Scanner
- **OLD**: Ran every 30 seconds
- **NEW**: Runs every **15 seconds** ⚡ (2x faster)
- **Coverage**: Scans ALL pending wallets as backup

**Result**: Payments should be detected within **5-15 seconds** instead of 30-60 seconds

### 2. Enhanced Sweep Function (SOL Forwarding)

#### New Features Added:
✅ **Retry Logic**: Up to 3 attempts with 5-second delays
✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: Every step logged with emojis
✅ **Error Details**: Full stack traces for debugging
✅ **Transaction Verification**: Confirms wallet reconstruction
✅ **RPC Verification**: Logs which network is being used
✅ **Explorer Links**: Includes Solana Explorer URLs

#### Detailed Logging Output:
```
💸 [Sweep] Attempt 1/3 - Forwarding from 8e1eP2QX...
💸 [Sweep] Amount: 8825000 lamports (0.008825 SOL)
💸 [Sweep] Destination: EC2cPxi4VbyzGoWMucHQ6LwkWz1W9vZE7ZApcY9PFsMy
💸 [Sweep] RPC: https://api.devnet.solana.com
💸 [Sweep] Source wallet (reconstructed): 8e1eP2QXHs7NgD2ZDHp2NHQaF4uvEiUR6jfrufhMRRYL
💸 [Sweep] Transfer amount (after fee): 8820000 lamports (0.008820 SOL)

✅ [Sweep] Explorer: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/5yoVQ.../devnet
```

#### Error Handling:
- Catches all exceptions with full stack traces
- Retries failed transactions automatically
- Marks wallet as `forward_failed` after 3 attempts
- Stores error details in database for manual review

### 3. Verification - Your Previous Payment

**Your wallet sweep DID work!** ✅

**Proof:**
```javascript
{
  wallet_address: '8e1eP2QXHs7NgD2ZDHp2NHQaF4uvEiUR6jfrufhMRRYL',
  sol_forwarded: true,
  forward_signature: '5yoVQhmf4Le5H3Mi7gJgYfvLRqu6ujFEztNZ5EGLvpNrTFcgahTgex4DvwiUJUCM3dbjYGrbv4p3AzcJzjHiyrNG',
  forwarded_amount_lamports: 8820000,  // 0.00882 SOL
  forwarded_at: '2025-10-13T16:08:55.765Z',
  status: 'completed'
}
```

**Transaction Verified:**
- ✅ Transaction succeeded on Solana devnet
- ✅ Main wallet received the SOL
- ✅ Main wallet balance: 0.836513 SOL (includes your payment)
- ✅ Explorer: [View on Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/5yoVQhmf4Le5H3Mi7gJgYfvLRqu6ujFEztNZ5EGLvpNrTFcgahTgex4DvwiUJUCM3dbjYGrbv4p3AzcJzjHiyrNG?cluster=devnet)

**The 7-minute delay was because:**
- The old monitoring system was checking mainnet instead of devnet
- After we fixed the `.env` loading issue, detection became fast
- Now with 5-second real-time checks + 15-second scanner, it will be MUCH faster

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Real-time check interval | 10s | **5s** | 2x faster ⚡ |
| Redundant scan interval | 30s | **15s** | 2x faster ⚡ |
| Expected detection time | 30-60s | **5-15s** | ~4x faster ⚡ |
| Sweep retry attempts | 1 (no retry) | **3 attempts** | Much more reliable |
| Sweep logging | Basic | **Comprehensive** | Full visibility |
| Error recovery | Manual | **Automatic** | Self-healing |

## 🔍 How to Monitor

### Real-Time Logs
Watch payment detection and sweeps in real-time:
```bash
# Watch all payment activity
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log | grep -E "💰|💸|✅|❌|🔍"

# Watch sweep activity only
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log | grep "Sweep"

# Watch scanner activity
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log | grep "Rescan"
```

### Manual Rescan
Force immediate check of all pending wallets:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://casinosol.preview.emergentagent.com/api/admin/rescan-payments?admin_key=PRODUCTION_CLEANUP_2025"
```

Check specific wallet:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://casinosol.preview.emergentagent.com/api/admin/rescan-payments?admin_key=PRODUCTION_CLEANUP_2025&wallet_address=<ADDRESS>"
```

## 🎯 What's Next - Testing Recommendations

### Test the New Speed:

1. **Create new payment wallet** in the app
2. **Send devnet SOL** to the wallet
3. **Watch the logs** to see detection happen within 5-15 seconds
4. **Verify sweep** happens immediately after detection
5. **Check main wallet** balance increased

### Expected Timeline:
```
T+0s:  User sends SOL to temporary wallet
T+5s:  Real-time monitor detects transaction (or scanner at T+15s)
T+6s:  Tokens credited to user account
T+7s:  SOL sweep initiated to main wallet
T+10s: Sweep transaction confirmed on-chain
```

**Total time: ~10-15 seconds from payment to completion** ⚡
