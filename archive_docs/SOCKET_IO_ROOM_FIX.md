# Socket.IO Room Management Fix

## Problem Statement
Players in Bronze, Silver, and Gold game rooms were experiencing critical synchronization issues:
- **Global Event Broadcasting**: All Socket.IO events were being broadcast to ALL connected clients instead of specific room participants
- **Repeating Winner Modals**: Winner announcement screens appeared multiple times or to wrong players
- **Room Participant Desync**: Player lists not updating in real-time within rooms
- **Cross-Room Contamination**: Players in Bronze room seeing events from Silver/Gold rooms

## Root Cause
The `socket_rooms.py` module existed with proper room management functions but was **NEVER IMPORTED OR USED** in `server.py`. All Socket.IO events used `sio.emit()` without a `room` parameter, causing global broadcasts.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes (`/app/backend/server.py`)

#### A. Import Socket Rooms Module
```python
import socket_rooms
```

#### B. User-Socket Mapping
Added dictionaries to track which socket belongs to which user:
```python
user_to_socket: Dict[str, str] = {}  # user_id -> sid
socket_to_user: Dict[str, str] = {}  # sid -> user_id
```

#### C. New Socket.IO Event Handlers

**1. `register_user` Event**
- Called when client connects and has a user_id
- Maps user_id to socket_id for room-specific event delivery
- Emits `user_registered` confirmation

**2. `join_game_room` Event**
- Called after successful REST API `/join-room` call
- Joins socket to specific game room using `socket_rooms.join_socket_room()`
- Updates user-socket mappings
- Emits `room_joined_confirmed` confirmation

**3. Enhanced `disconnect` Handler**
- Cleans up socket from all rooms using `socket_rooms.cleanup_socket()`
- Removes user-socket mappings
- Properly handles reconnection scenarios

#### D. Updated Event Broadcasting

**Before (Global Broadcast - WRONG):**
```python
await sio.emit('player_joined', {...})  # Goes to ALL clients
```

**After (Room-Specific - CORRECT):**
```python
await socket_rooms.broadcast_to_room(sio, room.id, 'player_joined', {...})  # Only to room participants
```

**Events Fixed:**
1. ✅ `player_joined` - Now room-specific
2. ✅ `room_full` - New event, room-specific
3. ✅ `game_starting` - Now room-specific
4. ✅ `game_finished` - Now room-specific
5. ✅ `prize_won` - Now sent to winner's socket ID only

**Events Kept Global (Intentionally):**
- `rooms_updated` - Lobby needs to see all room states
- `new_room_available` - Global notification for new rooms

### 2. Frontend Changes (`/app/frontend/src/App.js`)

#### A. Register User on Connect
```javascript
newSocket.on('connect', () => {
  // Register user to socket mapping if user is logged in
  const storedUser = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('casino_user_session') || '{}');
  if (storedUser && storedUser.id) {
    newSocket.emit('register_user', { user_id: storedUser.id });
  }
});
```

#### B. Join Socket Room After REST API Join
```javascript
if (response.data.status === 'joined') {
  // Join the Socket.IO room for room-specific events
  if (socket && socket.connected) {
    socket.emit('join_game_room', {
      room_id: response.data.room_id,
      user_id: user.id
    });
  }
  // ... rest of lobby setup
}
```

#### C. New Event Listeners
```javascript
// Confirmation events
newSocket.on('user_registered', (data) => {
  console.log('✅ User registered to socket:', data);
});

newSocket.on('room_joined_confirmed', (data) => {
  console.log('✅ Room joined confirmed:', data.room_id);
});

// Room full event with explosive notification
newSocket.on('room_full', (data) => {
  toast.success(data.message || '🚀 ROOM IS FULL! GET READY!', {
    style: { 
      background: 'linear-gradient(to right, #22c55e, #10b981)',
      fontSize: '18px',
      fontWeight: 'bold'
    }
  });
});
```

## Architecture Flow

### 1. Player Joins Room
```
Player → REST API: POST /api/join-room
          ↓
Backend: Validates & adds player to room
          ↓
Backend: Emits player_joined to ROOM participants only
          ↓
Frontend: Receives event, calls socket.emit('join_game_room')
          ↓
Backend: Joins socket to Socket.IO room
          ↓
Frontend: Room participant list updates
```

### 2. Room Becomes Full
```
3rd Player joins → Backend detects room full
          ↓
Backend: Emits room_full to ROOM participants only
          ↓
Frontend: Shows "🚀 ROOM IS FULL!" notification
          ↓
Backend: Starts game countdown
```

### 3. Game Starts & Finishes
```
Backend: Emits game_starting to ROOM participants
          ↓
Frontend: All room participants see "Game starting"
          ↓
Backend: Selects winner, emits game_finished to ROOM
          ↓
Frontend: All room participants see winner announcement
          ↓
Backend: Emits prize_won to WINNER'S socket only
          ↓
Frontend: Only winner receives prize link
```

## Testing Protocol

### Critical Test Scenarios

1. **Multi-Room Isolation**
   - Start Bronze and Silver rooms simultaneously with different players
   - Verify Bronze players only see Bronze events
   - Verify Silver players only see Silver events
   - Verify no cross-contamination

2. **Winner Modal Single Display**
   - Join room with 3 players
   - Complete game round
   - Verify winner modal appears exactly ONCE per player
   - Verify only winner receives prize_won event

3. **Real-Time Participant Updates**
   - Open room in multiple browsers/devices
   - Join players sequentially
   - Verify participant list updates in real-time for all players in that room
   - Verify counts: 1/3 → 2/3 → 3/3

4. **Disconnect Handling**
   - Join room, then disconnect
   - Verify socket cleanup happens
   - Reconnect and verify can join new room

5. **Room Full Animation**
   - Join room as 3rd player
   - Verify all 3 participants see "ROOM IS FULL!" explosive notification
   - Verify game starts automatically

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `/app/backend/server.py` - Main implementation
- `/app/backend/socket_rooms.py` - Already existed, now integrated

### Frontend
- `/app/frontend/src/App.js` - Socket event handlers and room join logic

## Deployment
- **Domain**: `https://solana-battles-1.preview.emergentagent.com`
- **Status**: ✅ Both backend and frontend running
- **Ready for Testing**: Yes - user can test via Telegram Mini Web App

## Next Steps for User

1. **Update Telegram Mini Web App URL** (if needed):
   - Point to: `https://solana-battles-1.preview.emergentagent.com`

2. **Test Game Flow**:
   - Join Bronze room with 3 different Telegram accounts
   - Verify participant list updates in real-time
   - Verify winner announcement appears once
   - Test with multiple room types simultaneously

3. **Monitor Logs** (if issues):
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log | grep -i "room\|socket\|joined"
   ```

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Events isolated to specific rooms
- ✅ No cross-room event contamination
- ✅ Winner modal appears exactly once per game
- ✅ Participant lists update in real-time
- ✅ Proper disconnect/cleanup handling
- ⏳ User confirmation via manual Telegram testing

## Known Limitations
- **Reconnection**: If a player disconnects during game, they're removed from the room. Future enhancement: allow rejoin
- **Spectator Mode**: Not implemented - players must be participants to receive events
- **RPC**: Using public Solana RPC (rate limited) - Helius API key needed for production
