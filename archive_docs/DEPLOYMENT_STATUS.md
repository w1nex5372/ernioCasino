## Known Issues

### 1. Socket.IO Connection Through Proxy
**Issue**: Socket.IO polling endpoint returns HTML instead of handshake
```bash
curl https://telebet-2.preview.emergentagent.com/socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=polling
```
Returns: HTML page instead of Socket.IO handshake

**Direct Backend Test** (works):
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=polling
```
Returns: `0{"sid":"...","upgrades":["websocket"],...}`

**Impact**: Socket.IO connections may fail through the external domain

### 2. No Recent Socket.IO Connections
Backend logs show no recent client connections, suggesting:
- Telegram WebApp may be cached with old version
- Socket.IO proxy routing may need configuration
- Users need to force refresh in Telegram

## For User: Telegram Mini App Setup

### Current Configuration
**Use this exact URL in Telegram Bot Settings:**
```
https://telebet-2.preview.emergentagent.com
```

### Verification Steps

1. **Clear Telegram Cache**:
   - Close Telegram completely
   - Clear app cache (iOS: Settings → Data → Clear Cache)
   - Reopen and test

2. **Force Refresh in Telegram**:
   - Open the Mini App
   - Pull down to refresh (if available)
   - Or close and reopen the chat

3. **Verify Latest Version**:
   - Open browser console in Telegram WebApp
   - Look for: `✅ CACHE CLEAR COMPLETE - App Version: 8.0-WINNER-FIX-v5-20250114`
   - Look for: `🔌 Connecting to WebSocket`

4. **Test Socket.IO Connection**:
   - Console should show: `✅✅✅ WebSocket CONNECTED! ID: ...`
   - If not, there's a Socket.IO proxy issue

### Testing the New Features

Once connected, test with 3 players:

1. **Player 1 joins Bronze room**
   - Console: `📥 EVENT: player_joined {room: "bronze", count: 1}`
   - Console: `✅ Participant list REPLACED for bronze`

2. **Player 2 joins Bronze room**
   - Console: `📥 EVENT: player_joined {room: "bronze", count: 2}`
   
3. **Player 3 joins Bronze room**
   - Console: `📥 EVENT: player_joined {room: "bronze", count: 3}`
   - Console: `📥 EVENT: room_full`
   - **Screen: "🚀 GET READY! 🚀" appears full-screen**
   - Console: `📥 EVENT: room_ready {match_id: "...", countdown: 3}`
   - Console: `✅ GET READY animation started`
   - **Countdown: 3 → 2 → 1**
   - Console: `📥 EVENT: game_starting {match_id: "..."}`
   - Console: `📥 EVENT: game_finished {match_id: "..."}`
   - Console: `✅ Match marked as shown`

### Backend Log Monitoring

If you have access to backend logs, watch for:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log | grep -E "player_joined|room_full|room_ready|match_id"
```

Expected output when 3 players join:
```
INFO: 👤 Player Alice joined room abc123 (1/3)
INFO: ✅ Emitted player_joined to room abc123 with 1 players
INFO: 👤 Player Bob joined room abc123 (2/3)
INFO: ✅ Emitted player_joined to room abc123 with 2 players
INFO: 👤 Player Charlie joined room abc123 (3/3)
INFO: ✅ Emitted player_joined to room abc123 with 3 players
INFO: 🚀 ROOM FULL! Starting game sequence...
INFO: ✅ Emitted room_full to room abc123
INFO: 🎮 Starting game round, match_id: a1b2c3d4e5f6
INFO: ✅ Emitted room_ready to room abc123
INFO: ✅ Emitted game_starting to room abc123
INFO: ✅ Emitted game_finished, winner: Alice, match_id: a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

## Domain Status Summary

| Domain | Status | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `solana-battles-1.preview.emergentagent.com` | ✅ ACTIVE | Current deployment |
| `solana-battles.preview.emergentagent.com` | ❌ 404 | Environment variable (inactive) |

## Troubleshooting

### If Changes Don't Appear:

1. **Telegram Cache Issue**:
   - Solution: Clear Telegram cache completely
   - Last resort: Uninstall and reinstall Telegram

2. **Socket.IO Not Connecting**:
   - Check console for WebSocket errors
   - Verify URL is correct
   - Test direct browser access first

3. **Old Code Still Running**:
   - Verify bundle.js contains "room_ready"
   - Check console for version: "8.0-WINNER-FIX-v5"
   - Force refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R (browser)

### If Socket.IO Fails Through Proxy:

This is a Kubernetes ingress routing issue. The Socket.IO endpoint needs special configuration to handle WebSocket upgrades and polling requests properly.

**Temporary Workaround**: Test in regular browser first
- Go to: https://telebet-2.preview.emergentagent.com
- Open browser DevTools
- Test game flow
- If it works in browser but not Telegram, it's a Telegram cache issue
